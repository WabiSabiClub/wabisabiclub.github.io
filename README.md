  Wabi Sabi Game Dev Club is an open education initiative of micro communities dedicated to fostering game development as a powerful tool for social fun. We believe that games have the potential to create meaningful impact in society, and our mission is to bring together individuals who share this belief. The intention of this initiative is to enable like minded people to develop games together by providing the tools and ideas for social and fun activities and use this as a tool for social change.
