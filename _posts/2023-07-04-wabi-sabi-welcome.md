## Quick Start Guide

This section of the platform was created to give you a general idea of the type of content that will be uploaded to the Wabi Sabi Game Dev Club website. Not all content may be available when you visit the page, as it is constantly being worked on and made available as soon as it is completed by whoever is contributing to it. If you have any ideas to contribute, you can do so by following the contribution guide in the Github repository.

These are some activities for which we will be sharing all the necessary materials and knowledge so that you can organize your own club. If you have any ideas that you would like to share yourself please feel free to contribute to this website.

## Activities for your own Wabi Sabi Game Dev Club
1. **Social Events and Meetups**: Organize casual social events, both online and offline, to promote networking, build relationships, and foster a sense of camaraderie among members. This can include game nights, virtual hangouts, or local meetups for members to connect in person.

2. **Game Jams: Organize regular game jam events** where members can collaborate and create games within a specified time frame. Encourage participants to embrace imperfection and experiment with unconventional approaches to game design.

3. **Workshops and Tutorials**: Conduct workshops and tutorials on various aspects of game development, ranging from programming and art to storytelling and game design. Encourage experienced members to share their knowledge and mentor others, fostering a culture of continuous learning and growth.

4. **Feedback and Playtesting Sessions**: Facilitate regular feedback and playtesting sessions where members can showcase their game projects and receive constructive feedback from the community. Encourage open discussions and provide a supportive environment for sharing ideas and improving game projects.

5. **Developer Spotlights**: Highlight the work of individual members or micro-communities within the club by featuring their games, projects, or achievements. This can inspire others, promote collaboration, and foster a sense of recognition within the community.

6. **Collaborative Game Projects**: Initiate collaborative game development projects where members can work together on a shared game concept. Encourage diverse skill sets and backgrounds to come together, creating an inclusive and collaborative environment.

7. **Community Challenges**: Organize creative challenges or competitions within the community, such as creating games with specific themes, limitations, or styles. These challenges can foster creativity, inspire innovation, and provide opportunities for members to connect and learn from one another.

10. **Community Showcases and Exhibitions**: Arrange opportunities for members to showcase their games or projects to a broader audience, such as participating in game expos, exhibitions, or organizing dedicated community showcases. This can provide exposure, feedback, and networking opportunities for members.

By actively engaging in these activities and initiatives, each Wabi Sabi Game Dev Club can cultivate a strong and supportive community, fostering collaboration, creativity, and personal growth among its members.
